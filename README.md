## Usage

#### If you want to add more art/artist you will need access to the wordpress domain AIAIAI.art. Access received? Nice, then follow the next steps to add more art!
- Login to the wordpress domain.
- Go to pages and add a new page.
- Make sure the page has the following layout: <br>
  <img width="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9eb617c-d3da-4046-b842-e4bff1ed67d2" />
- Every element (Artist name, Art type, Art description etc.) needs to have an "|" before and after like shown below. (Not a capital i) <br>
  <img width="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e782cb46-9967-4b7f-99d9-5886a3ca92f0" />
- If you want to add extra images you will need to add at least 3 image links. <br>
  <img width="666" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3f956e7-3232-4f0a-8096-942d6c977332" /> <br>
If it's less the page won't work. A other option is to not add the extra images.
- Publish the page and tada, it's added to the website!
